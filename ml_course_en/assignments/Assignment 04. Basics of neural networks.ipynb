    "## General Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing the practical work, you need download the data set accordingly to the option on your machine\n",
    "1. Write a program that splits the original sample into a training set and a test set (training set, validation set, test set)\n",
    "2. Build a model using [Perceptron](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.html) and [MLPClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html). On the basis of experiments with MLPClassifier, select best values for learning rate, the regularization parameter, the optimization function. Try different architectures for the MLPClassifier (number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer). Use [f1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html) for evaluation.\n",
    "3. Build learning curves for better explanation of your experiments for training set and validation set on the same plot (f1_score on the max_iter parameter for MLPClassifier).\n",
